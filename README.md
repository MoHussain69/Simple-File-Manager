# Simple-File-Manager
This C# application allows you to sort file types from any folder and send them to another. Perfect for organising messy folders quickly!

After clicking start, you will be prompted to select 2 folders, 1 folder for the program to sort through and organise, and another to move files to. You must speicfy the file type of the files. This can only sort 1 file type at a time.

The optional segment allows you to select files that begin with a specific string of characters. This is case insensitive.

Once you're done, simply click run and the program will let you know when it is complete!
